      <div>
        <h1 class="section-title">About me</h1>
        <h3>"The glue"</h3>
        <p> During my first job in Spain, I remember my team lead giving me my first yearly productivity review, and he
          said "You are the glue that keeps this team together and coordinated". Ever since the beginning, I enjoyed being
          helpful to my team. I'm always suggesting ways to improve the tools that we use on our day to day. Am I shy at
          the beginning? sure! But once I get to know my team, the flow of new ideas, suggestions and possible
          improvements won't stop.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Problem solver</h3>
        <p> Being painfully honest, I am not the most technical person you will find out there. But I do just fine because
          even when I don't know the solution to my problem, I know how to find one. I'm always eager to solve whatever
          problem we may face, and not knowing the solution only makes it more interesting to solve!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Agile methodologies nerd</h3>
        <p>I LOVE and I can't stress this enough, really love working in teams that practice Agile methodologies. I've had
          the chance of working with teams implementing as pure of Agile methodologies as you'll ever see work in practice.
          And it made me love how productive it made us all and how simple it is to make little changes to make things
          better thanks to the constant feedback.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Approachable and friendly</h3>
        <p>Have you ever had someone in your team that is always grumpy? Always disagreeing with everyone else? Well,
          that's NOT me! You can count on me to speak my mind freely and give my opinion on debates, but I will always
          listen to my peers ideas and consider them as a valid possibility before providing any arguments. I believe
          everyone deserves to have a voice and no one should be shut down before being heard.
